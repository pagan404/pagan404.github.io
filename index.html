                <p class="article-intro-paragraph">Interested how private or traceable Bitcoin is? This series of articles is just for you! In them, I examine just how far a determined investigator can get in tracking Bitcoin transactions. Even without any paid tools or programming skills. Assuming the role of the attacker is a great way to learn about privacy and in this first part we go over the main basic assumptions we can draw from Bitcoin transactions as well as the best free and publicly available tools to analyse them.</p>
